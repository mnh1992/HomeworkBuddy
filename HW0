2. Project Proposal for Homework Management System
                        WhiteBoard
WhiteBoard is a homework management system for college students and teachers. This system will allow teachers
to post homework for different classes, and the homework will be automatically added to every studentâ€™s account 
with an auto generated email notification. Upon registration, students will select their school and the courses 
they are taking while teachers will select their school and courses they are teaching. For each homework, students 
will be able to store related resources such as notes, links, files etc. In addition, students will have the ability 
to share the resources with a group of students of their choice. This system will allow students and teachers to manage 
the discussions per homework basis. Also, teachers and students will have the option to receive email notifications 
related to discussions. Students will have the option to receive homework deadline alerts via email. There will also be 
a discussion board where students could post and answer questions about homework assignments and projects, as well as 
share a virtual whiteboard where they can work out problems together. In summary, WhiteBoard will include most of the 
features currently available in Blackboard and Piazza with additional features that are not available in those systems.
Technically, the system uses the JournalTOCs API to embed the searching functionality within the website. 
MatchCollege API can be used to retrieve information about the US colleges and universities. Also, 
DOForms API is used to collect and store user information retrieved through forms.
