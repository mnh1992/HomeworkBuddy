Homework Management System

4 Scenarios

1. Registration-verifying that  the ID the user has chosen  is unique , and not already in the database
2. Search for online homework resources by keywords  through an input element on their home page.
3. Browse list of books. Using a D3.js tree map visualization, the books are shown  with individual headlines and grouped together by subject. 
4. View posts of Q&A form. When a user hovers over a post, a popup is displayed that contains a short snippet of the post.


The two scenarios that we are doing for HW 3 are:

1. Registration-verifying that  the ID the user has chosen  is unique , and not already in the database
2. Search for online homework resources by keywords  through an input element on their home page.

Homework 4 Scenarios implemented:

1. Registration-verifying that  the ID the user has chosen  is unique , and not already in the database (used react)
2. Select an school from a list generated by an api (used react)
3. Once the user logged in he is given the choice to add courses as he need, and their choices will be stored in the firebase database.

Homework 5:
 1. Data visualization was implemented as a sorted bar graph. To access this, use the Statistics tab in the landingpage.html.
 2. The third scenario of course selection was moved to react. To access this, use the signup, then login with correct credentials. Once logged it displays a link for course registration. The one for posting homework is not relevant to this homework
